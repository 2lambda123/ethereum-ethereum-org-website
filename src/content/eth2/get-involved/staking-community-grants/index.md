# Eth2 Staking Community Grants

_The Ethereum Foundation is sponsoring a wave of eth2 staking community grants. Proposals are due December 22, 2020. Here are all the details you need._

<Divider />

Calling all those interested in building up the Ethereum 2.0 staking and validator community!

Ethereum 2.0 is here. The mainnet deposit contract address is [deployed](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/deposit-contract/). And [genesis](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/genesis) of the Beacon Chain is [right around the corner](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/04/eth2-quick-update-no-19/). Which means, stakers are gearing up to stake.

The Ethereum Foundation is running a wave of Eth2 Staking Community Grants because staking is fundamental to eth2. And as such the eth2 staking community requires tools, documentation and resources to make for a delightful staking and validator experience. While the spirited eth2 staker ecosystem has already made great progress with respect to public good community resources, we are still in the early days and there's more work to do!

Staking Education. Tooling. Community. Security. Research. Data analysis. If you're working on cultivating the eth2 staking ecosystem, read on!

Wait, how do I get started with staking? If you're first getting up to speed with eth2 and staking, you'll want to practice by giving the Medalla testnet a whirl. See <a href="/en/eth2/get-involved/#medalla">how to stake on Medalla</a>

## The open call ü¶Ñ

Eth2 Staking Community Grants is an open call for proposals targeted towards the eth2 staking community. Meaning, the initiative is open to staking-related ideas and projects at any stage of development. Idea phase. Proof of concept. Work in progress. Fleshed out project. We want to hear about it. The aim is to support consistent and ongoing work that builds up the eth2 staking ecosystem over time.

The open call centers around three core categories:

- Staking Education & Community
- Staking & Validator Tools
- Data Analysis & Visualizations

For example:

- _Are you building end-to-end staking guides for different clients on various platforms?_
- _Are you writing crisp, clear staking documentation?_
- _Are you teaching stakers of all levels, from beginner to advanced, through video and written tutorials?_
- _Are you building a staking wiki focused on best practices and security? What novel ways can you dream up to encourage people to contribute?_
- _Are you experimenting with sophisticated staking setups and detailing out guides/tools for the community to reproduce and understand tradeoffs?_
- _What engaging diagrams or illustrations of the Beacon Chain are you creating?_
- _How can you make it easier to retrieve live data from the Beacon Chain?_
- _What data analyses and visualizations can give stakers live insights into the network?_
- _What new staking tools are you building?_

But other topic areas are welcome too! Be it research, testing frameworks, infographics, and on. The point of the program is to help contribute to the long term health of the eth2 staking and validator community. If your proposal advances this aim, tell us about it!

In addition to the prompt questions above, here's a [wishlist of avenues to explore](https://www.notion.so/efdn/Wishlist-Eth2-Community-Staking-Grants-bcd96599dace4db292614fe71ea3748e).

## Quick FAQ ü¶Ñ

### Who can submit proposals for Eth2 Staking Community Grants?

- Anybody! Individuals and teams.

### How do I submit a proposal?

- Follow the steps via the submission [form]()!

### What makes for a good proposal?

The more detailed information, the better. Examples:

- Showing a clear grasp of the problem you're trying to solve
- Clearly identifying your project's impact and how it would help the eth2 staking ecosystem
- Providing a detailed description of your project

In short, we need enough information to understand your goals, your motivation and your challenges. The more details you provide, the better.

### What state does my idea or project need to be in?

- Any stage of development!
- If you have an idea or project that benefits the eth2 staking community, submit a proposal! The goal is to support regular, consistent work that pushes forward the eth2 staking ecosystem.
- Eth2 Staking Community Grants is an open call for _proposals_. Which means, it's expected that some ideas or projects won't be fully shipped before the deadline, but instead require ongoing effort.

### What if I miss the deadline?

- The Ethereum Foundation runs a general grants initiative called the [Ecosystem Support Program](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/) (ESP).
- At any time, you may submit an inquiry for support through ESP.
- Thus, if you miss the deadline for this dedicated round of grants but have a proposal related to eth2 staking, head on over to [ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation).

### How do I get started with staking and becoming a validator?

- If you're new to staking, we encourage you to practice first on a testnet before moving to mainnet.

  - Work through the [Medalla launchpad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/) steps to set up a validator on the Medalla testnet.

- Once you're ready for mainnet, head on over to the official [Eth2 Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) to set up your eth2 validator.
  - Remember to [check the deposit contract address](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/deposit-contract/) before staking any ETH!
