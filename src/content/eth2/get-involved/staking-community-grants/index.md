# Eth2 Staking Community Grants

_The Ethereum Foundation is sponsoring a wave of eth2 staking community grants. Proposals are due December 22, 2020. Here are all the details you need._

<Divider />

Calling all those interested in building up the Ethereum 2.0 staking and validator community!

Ethereum 2.0 is happening! The mainnet deposit contract address is [deployed](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/deposit-contract/). And [genesis](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/genesis) of the Beacon Chain is [right around the corner](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/04/eth2-quick-update-no-19/). Which means, stakers are gearing up to stake.

The Ethereum Foundation is funding the creation of tools, documentation, and resources to make for a delightful staking and validator experience. While the spirited staker ecosystem has already made great progress with respect to public good community resources, we are still in the early days and there's more work to do!

Eth2 Staking Community Grants is an open call for proposals, centered around three main categories:

- Staking Education & Community
- Staking & Validator Tools
- Data Analysis & Visualizations

But other topic areas are welcome too! In short, if you're working on cultivating the eth2 staking ecosystem, read on!

Wait, how do I get started with staking? Learn [what staking means](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/), or try it first on the [Medalla testnet](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/)</a>

<Button to="https://ethereumfoundation.typeform.com/to/SqN5shuA">Submit your proposal</Button>

Grants are decided on a case-by-case basis and you may enter more than one proposal! So long as each proposal is unique and meets the [requirements](/#requirements).

### Deadline ‚è∞

The deadline for proposals is any time the day of Tuesday, December 22, 2020.

We will follow-up with you about your submission by email.

### Requirements üéØ

- Proposals must be in English
- Work must be open source with a free and permissive license
- If published work, it must be accessible by url

### Selection Criteria üóíÔ∏è

_Surprise us with your creativity! But here are a few selection criteria considerations (depending on the submission type some criteria might not be applicable):_

- Potential impact on broadening the staker community
- Quality of contribution to the staking tooling ecosystem
- Clarity, conciseness and organization of documentation
- Novelty in reducing the barrier of entry to staking
- Insights that lead to substantive changes in client implementations or specifications
- Analyses or visualizations that help a non-technical audience gain insight into the network
- Overall quality and clarity of data analysis or data visualization.

## Examples

Here are some prompt questions that may help inspire you:

- _Are you building end-to-end staking guides for different clients on various platforms?_
- _Are you writing crisp, clear staking documentation?_
- _Are you teaching stakers of all levels, from beginner to advanced, through video and written tutorials?_
- _Are you building a staking wiki focused on best practices and security? What novel ways can you dream up to encourage people to contribute?_
- _Are you experimenting with sophisticated staking setups and detailing out guides/tools for the community to reproduce and understand tradeoffs?_
- _What engaging diagrams or illustrations of the Beacon Chain are you creating?_
- _How can you make it easier to retrieve live data from the Beacon Chain?_
- _What data analyses and visualizations can give stakers live insights into the network?_
- _What new staking tools are you building?_
- _How can you make a stakers life easier, more productive, or just generally more delightful?_

Other topic areas are welcome too! Be it research, testing frameworks, infographics, and so on. The point of the program is to help contribute to the long term health of the Eth2 staking and validator community. If your proposal advances this aim, tell us about it!

In addition to the prompt questions above, here's a wishlist of avenues to explore.

## Quick FAQ ü¶Ñ

### Who can submit proposals for Eth2 Staking Community Grants?

- Anybody! Individuals and teams.

### How do I submit a proposal?

- Follow the steps via the submission [form](https://ethereumfoundation.typeform.com/to/SqN5shuA)!

### What makes for a good proposal?

The more detailed information, the better. Examples:

- Showing a clear grasp of the problem you're trying to solve
- Clearly identifying your project's impact and how it would help the eth2 staking ecosystem
- Providing a detailed description of your project

In short, we need enough information to understand your goals, your motivation and your challenges. The more details you provide, the better.

### What state does my idea or project need to be in?

- Any stage of development!
- If you have an idea or project that benefits the eth2 staking community, submit a proposal! The goal is to support regular, consistent work that pushes forward the eth2 staking ecosystem.
- Eth2 Staking Community Grants is an open call for _proposals_. Which means, it's expected that some ideas or projects won't be fully shipped before the deadline, but instead require ongoing effort.

### What if I miss the deadline?

- The Ethereum Foundation runs a general grants initiative called the [Ecosystem Support Program](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/) (ESP).
- At any time, you may submit an inquiry for support through ESP.
- Thus, if you miss the deadline for this dedicated round of grants but have a proposal related to eth2 staking, head on over to [ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation).

- If you're new to staking, we encourage you to practice first on a testnet before moving to mainnet.

  - Work through the [Medalla launchpad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/) steps to set up a validator on the Medalla testnet.

- Once you're ready for real ETH, head on over to the [Eth2 Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) to set up your eth2 validator.
  - Remember to [check the deposit contract address](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/deposit-contract/) before staking any ETH!
