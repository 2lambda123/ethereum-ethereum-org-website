Public goods are commodities and services provided to all members of a society (without the possibility of direct profit) usually by government or private organizations. While the creation of public goods is critical to societal progress and wellbeing, traditional models of coordinating to fund public goods suffer problems that limit their efficiency and effectiveness. This makes it difficult to build useful public goods and results in worse outcomes that affect everyone. 

But there might be a solution to the problems of funding public goods: blockchain technology. By applying cryptoeconomic incentives and mechanism designs, new blockchain-based projects are fixing the broken model of traditional public goods funding and solving coordination failures that plague modern markets. 

## What is a public good? {#what-is-a-public-good} 

As mentioned, public goods are defined as commodities or services made freely available to all members of a society. For a commodity or service to be classified as a public good, it must possess the folllowing characteristics: 

1. **Nonexcludable**: A public good is *nonexcludable* in the sense that it is costly or impossible to exclude any individual from accessing it. A public road is one example of a public good—no one can prevent you from driving on it (provided you have a license). 

2. **Nonrivalrous**: A public good is *nonrivalrous*, meaning that one person consuming the commodity doesn't prevent another person from doing the same. Going back to the previous example: if you drive on a public road, that doesn't prevent another person from driving on the same road. 

A **private good** is the opposite: they are *rivalrous* and *excludable*. For example, if Alice eats a slice of pizza, then Bob cannot eat the same slice of (Alice and Bob are "rivals" in consumption). More so, by eating the slice of pizza, Alice prevents (or "excludes") Bob from eating it, making it excludable.

Many public goods are also marked by their "positive externalities". An externality is an indirect cost or benefit borne by   A positive externan meaning that i benefits of providing it outweigh the disadvantages.Other examples of public goods include:

- Education 
- Access to information 
- Open-source software 
- Roads
- Public healthcare 
- Access to clean air
- Law enforcement and national defense 

## Why is funding public goods important? {#importance-of-funding-public-goods} 

Unlike [private goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-good.asp), public goods provide benefits for the majority, not just one individual. Such goods are necessary in creating a future that results in positive outcomes for all members of society. Public roads, for example, facilitate commerce and increase societal prosperity and wellbeing. 

Traditionally, public goods are usually made available by governments (through taxes collected from citizens). Private markets can also create public goods: the radio is an example of a public good—broadcast stations cannot prevent listeners from receiving signals (i.e., it is nonexcludable) and multiple individuals can listen at the same time (i.e., it is nonrivalrous). 

However, the conventional models of building and funding public goods run into various problems. Not only have these issues stymied the development of public goods, but it has also resulted in public goods with [negative externalities](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/negative-externalities/). 

### Problems of traditional public goods funding  {problems-of-traditional-public-goods-funding} 
  
### 1. Misaligned incentives {#misaligned-incentives} 

Traditional methods of funding public goods suffer from misaligned incentives among different entities coordinating to allocate resources. These incentive problems can be described using several concepts from economic theory:

#### The free-rider problem {#free-rider-problem} 

The [free-rider problem](https://bit.ly/3ATE3KC) describes a situation whereby some individuals refuse to pay towards building a public good, but intend to use it. In this case, such individuals are "taking a free ride" on the contributions of others towards funding the public good. 

The free-rider problem is central to the problem of funding public goods. If everyone refuses to pay for a public good, hoping someone else does, it becomes impossible to fund and build the public good. 

#### Tragedy of commons {#tragedy-of-commons} 

The [tragedy of commons](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp) concerns the degradation of commonly shared resources through overconsumption. A common resource is similar to a public good (they are nonexcludable), but can typically diminish in quality and availability as more people use it (i.e., they are rivalrous). 

Because individuals cannot prevent others from consuming the common resource, they are incentivized to take from the shared resource pool without replenishing it. But, as more people consume the resource, either of two things can happen: a) supply of the resource dwindles until there isn't any left for public consumption b) the quality of the resource degrades over time until it becomes unusable. Both situations are non-ideal, which is why solving the tragedy of commons is a key goal of new designs for funding public goods. 

#### Principal-agent problem {#principal-agent-problem} 

The [principal-agent problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem) is a concept that explains the conflict of interests between an individual (the principal) and another entity acting on their behalf (the agent). While the agent is expected to act in the best interests of their principal, they may pursue self-seeking ends. 

In the context of public goods, the principal-agent problem concerns differences in opinion between a group (e.g., citizens) and their representatives (e.g., elected government officials) as it concerns the allocation of resources to public goods. In this case, what the group considers a public good may be different from what representatives consider a public good. 

The problem is further compounded by lack of transparency and [information asymmetries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry). Often, those endowed with power to allocate resources to public goods misuse it and prevent accountability by shrouding administrative processes in secrecy. 

### 2. Poor resource-allocation mechanisms {#poor-resource-allocation-mechanisms} 

In funding public goods, it is necessary to have a mechanism for eliciting the preferences of individuals before allocating funds. Traditional public goods funding models are inefficient because they rely on poorly designed mechanisms for measuring public preferences, such as:

#### Democratic voting {#democratic-voting} 

Funding models that apply democratic voting ("one person, one vote") rules rely on the majority opinion to allocate funding for public goods. In theory, using the collective opinion to guide funding is a great idea. In reality, however, this system has problems:

1. **Rational indifference**: In a democratic voting scheme, the ability of each individual to influence the outcome is limited (you can only vote once). As such, those whom a public good benefits the most (for example, public healthcare for aged citizens) are unable to push for its production. This leads to individuals rationalizing nonparticipation ("Why bother voting when my vote matters little?"). 

2. **Voter ignorance**: Prioritizing the preferences of the majority may not necessarily lead to spending on the right public goods owing to widespread voter ignorance. In this case, informed voters are unable to push for the production of more beneficial public goods. 

3. **Negative externalities**: Another downside with democratic funding schemes is the cost borne by the minority. In democratic systems, those who may not necessarily need a public good are forced to pay the same as those who need it the most. For example, Bob (a risk-averse individual) is forced to pay taxes to subsidize medical procedures for Alice (a risk-seeking individual), even though Bob himself might never need such services. 

#### Plutocratic voting {#plutocratic-voting} 

Some funding models use a plutocratic mechanism in which an individual's financial power determines their influence on the process of providing public goods. These systems are typically described as "one dollar, one vote". In theory, plutocratic funding is ideal since it allows for expressing unequal preference for public goods—but it also has problems:

1. **Serving the rich**: Plutocratic voting prioritizes the preferences of the wealthy (who are often the minority) to the detriment of average income-earners that comprise the majority. Thus, public goods that matter to the majority (and have bigger societal benefits) may never receive funding. 

2. **Cost burdens**: It is possible for middle-class citizens to leverage crowdfunding mechanisms in order to compete against wealthy indivdiduals and collectively express their preferences for a public good. But this is considerably unfair since they still have to bear unfavorably higher costs when expressing preferences. 

3. **Negative externalities**: Public goods created via plutocratic mechanisms often produce negative externalities, mostly because of the need to maximize returns on investment. A classic example is the Internet as it exists today: because Internet businesses (e.g., social media platforms) cannot charge consumers directly, they rely on advertising to recoup investment in infrastructure. This is even as reports of the [negative effects of targeted advertising on individuals](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/the-goods/2020/4/9/21204425/targeted-ads-fertility-eating-disorder-coronavirus) continue to surface. 

## Improving public goods funding with blockchain technology {#blockchain-for-public-goods-funding} 

The problems explained in the previous section lead to "coordination failures" that stall the development of public goods. However, many believe the existence of decentralized blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, can help solve the problem of efficiently funding and developing public goods. 

### Regenerative cryptoeconomics and public goods markets {#regenerative-cryptoeconomics-and-public-goods-markets} 

"Regenerative cryptoeconomics" concerns using blockchain technology to design incentives and mechanisms that support regenerative economic systems. A regenerative economy is one that has positive environmental and social externalities that also generate more capital assets. 

This contrasts with an extractive economy in which resources are extracted without any attempt to replenish them. In this case, every individual act of consumption subtracts from the shared resource pool, leading to its eventual depletion. 

Regenerative systems are 'positive-sum': contributing replenishing a common resource benefits the individual *and* the group. In contrast, extractive systems are 'zero-sum': overconsuming a common resource benefits the individual in the short-term, but leads to worse long-term outcomes for the group (of which they are part).

A key contribution of regenerative cryptoeconomics is the creation and coordination of **public goods markets** using blockchains, such as Ethereum. A [public goods market](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZjBnzzqkrB7JNLjTg/the-case-for-promoting-creating-public-goods-markets-as-a) is defined as a "decentralized and highly responsive process for allocating capital according to the collective desires of a population to support the creation of public goods." 

Put simply, a public goods market provides a mechanism for private individuals to fund the development of public goods without relying on intermediaries. Decentralization and trustlessness are important features of blockchain-based public goods markets, which also separate them from other conventional crowdfunding mechanisms (e.g., Kickstarter). 

### Why do we need a public goods market? {#importance-of-public-goods-market} 

Currently, the majority of public goods are created by either governments or private markets—both of which have problems: 

1. Governments reduce the free-rider problem by charging people (i.e., the consumers) taxes, which it uses to fund the development of public goods. Put another way, the government returns money belonging to the citizenry to them in the form of public goods. However, this creates a negative externality, namely the cost borne by individuals who don't necessarily consume certain public goods. Moreover, funding of public goods by the public sector suffers from principal-agent problems and, in many cases, governments often lack the flexibility and capacity to provide certain public goods.  

2. Private markets can finance public goods efficiently, but the funding of public goods by the private sector has also runs into issues. For example, unlike govenrnments, private companies find it more difficult to charge consumers of a public good (and, thus, cannot solve the free-rider problem). This discourages the provision of certain public goods by private organization and results in a “market failure” (inefficient allocation of goods and services in a free market). In cases where private markets *do* provide a public good, the desire to maximize returns on investment may cause negative externalities, such as social media companies monetizing user data. 

A public goods market creates a third alternative that combines the best qualities of the two approaches while minimizing negative consequences. Here, members of the general public are able to coordinate on allocating capital to areas they believe are neglected but critical to societal wellbeing, prosperity, and progress. This approach is more flexible and efficient compared to traditional government-controlled funding, but also minimizes some of the negative externalities associated with funding public goods via the private sector. 

More importantly, a public goods market provides incentives for individuals and groups to work on creating services that benefit society, especially when they stand to make little to no profits. To illustrate this point, consider the free and open-source software (FOSS) industry:

Creators of open-source software, such as [OpenSSL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL), are rarely compensated and must rely on charitable donors to fund their work. This discourages developers working on those projects and further disincentivizes others from working on similar projects that could advance society's good. 

Blockchain-based public goods markets enable anyone to easily contribute to organizations building public goods in a decentralized, trust-minimized, and secure manner. Rewarding builders of public goods may avert the tragedy of commons and lead to better outcomes for society in general. 

## How can Ethereum advance public goods funding? {#using-ethereum-to-fund-public-goods} 

Ethereum's qualities—immutability, trustlessness, and decentralization—could make it a platform for improving conventional means of coordinating to develop public goods. As a programmable blockchain, Ethereum supports [smart contracts](/smart-contracts/), which are programs that execute instructions based on predefined conditions. Smart contracts are the core primitives that power public goods markets running on the blockchain.

With Ethereum, public goods, especially digital public goods (e.g., open-source software), that have historically suffered neglect can be funded efficiently. The benefits of using Ethereum to improve public goods funding include:

### Transparency {#transparency} 

Information stored on Ethereum is publicly available and can be verified by anyone. Ethereum is "trustless" because you don't have to trust anyone about the validity of information recorded on the blockchain. 

With public goods markets running on Ethereum, it is easier to track contributions towards the creation of a public good and monitor the allocation of these funds to projects. Instead of relying on representatives to be honest about funding decisions, you can verify for yourself that funds were allocated as agreed. 

Lower trust burdens further make it possible for individuals to coordinate on a global scale. Coordination failures arise in part due to a lack of transparency between those involved. An individual may be unwilling to participate in the development of public goods if information about the process is hidden or difficult to obtain. 

### Secure and seamless transfer of value {#secure-and-seamless-transfer-of-value} 

Ethereum provides infrastructure for [decentralized finance](/defi/) (DeFi), which allows individuals to safely transfer value without the need for an intermediary, like a bank. Using Ethereum, anyone with an Internet connection can [send money globally](/defi/#send-money) sans the usual paperwork and bureaucratic delays that plague the modern banking system. 

As a secure and efficient payments network, Ethereum reduces friction for individuals that want to fund public good projects. Simplifying the process of contributing towards a public good is a great first step towards creating a regenerative economy. 

Creators of public goods also benefit from Ethereum's capacity to enable seamless transfers of value. Getting funding for a public good on a traditional crowdsourcing platform would involve administrative complexity that could potentially discourage builders. 

With Ethereum's public goods markets, receiving money to build a public good is only a matter of providing a [wallet](/wallets/) address. This eliminates the need to complete extensive paperwork or depend on a centralized platform to collect donations. 

### Incentive alignment {#incentive-alignment} 

Public goods markets on Ethereum are designing better incentives to encourage greater public investment in digital public goods. Part of this approach involves designing better systems for measuring public opinion on what public goods deserve funding. 

For example, some Ethereum-based public goods markets use a quadratic voting system to control the allocation of funds to organizations building digital public goods. [Quadratic voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) is considered ideal because it strikes a balance between one-person-one-vote and one-dollar-one-vote systems. 

Below is an overview of how the combination of quadratic voting with public fundraising (**quadratic funding**) works:

1. Individuals and organizations donate funds to a  "matching pool" at the beginning of a funding round. These funds are distributed to different public goods projects at the end of the round based on their weighted share of votes. 

2. Anyone can "vote" for a project by donating some amount to it during the funding round. The influence of each voter is calculated as the square root of the amount donated. If Alice donates $100, her influence on the outcome equals that of ten people who contribute $1. 

3. Every donation towards a project is matched with a corresponding amount of funding from the official matching pool. Instead of being matched 1:1, funds are matched according to the [quadratic funding formula](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=10&grant=5,5&grant=2,2,2,2,2&grant=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1&match=1000). 

The formula works by adding the square roots of each contribution, squaring the result, and subtracting the original amount donated from it. The final figure represents the matched funding, i.e., how much money each project receives from the matching pool. We can explain this concept with an example:

Imagine two parks are planned for development, with the teams building each park (we call them `park A` and `park B`) requesting for funding. Ten people agree to donate $25 each to build `park A`, while two affluent investors donate $180 each to `park B`. 

The table below shows how much each park will receive under a quadratic funding scheme:

![A diagram showing showing funds received during a quadratic funding round](./quadratic-funding-table.png)

We can easily calculate the final amount received by each project using the quadratic formula: 

1. `Park A`: Adding the square roots of each donor's contribution ($5) gives $50. Subtracting the total amount contributed ($250) from the square of $50 ($2,500) gives $2,250—the matched funds. 

2. `Park B`: Adding the square roots of each donor's contribution ($20) gives $40. Subtracting the total amount contributed ($800) from the square of $40 ($1,600) gives $800—the matched funds. 

#### Advantages of quadratic funding {#advantages-of-quadratic-funding} 

Again, we can use the example of raising funds for public parks to show why quadratic funding is ideal for funding public goods:

##### Preventing the free-rider problem

Quadratic funding places more weight on the number of contributors than the amount contributed by each person. This ensures that public goods with a broader base of support receive more matched funding than public goods with minority backing—even if the latter have bigger donations during the funding round. 

As seen in the example, one person contributing **$25** individually generated **$225** in matched funding for `park A` ($2,250/10 people). If one person attempted to free-ride and refused to donate, then the matched funding would drop to **$1,775**. 

But what if the free-rider opts in and donates $25? The additional value gotten from that single donation would be **$475**. Because the value added by each donor is extremely high, no one is incentivized to try and free-ride—precisely the goal of quadratic funding. 
 
##### Preventing the tragedy of commons

Quadratic prioritizes the most preferred public goods by subsidizing their development (via matched funds). This is important because overused and underfunded public goods are more likely to degrade over time.

Imagine that `park A` and `park B` are built without receiving any matched funds. `Park A` would likely see more use (since more people expressed their preference for it) than `park B`. But, with less funds allocated to developing and maintaining it, `park A` would suffer rapid degeneration, resulting in a tragedy-of-commons situation. 

##### Preventing principal-agent problems

Typically, individuals would have to trust the local government, a private company, or a grant-giving committee to convey their preferences when building public goods. But either "representative" (government/private markets/grant committees) may be unable or unwilling to capture those preferences. 

The example of funding public parks shows how regular individuals can collectively and democratically express their preferences for public goods without relying on any authority. TThis explains why quadratic funding is described as "capital-constrained liberal radicalism": it shifts influence, power, and responsibility for public goods from governments and the private sector to the people. 

##### Accounting for differences in spending power and degree of preferences 

Naive implementations of democracy (one-person-one vote) and plutocracy (one-dollar-one-vote) fail to account for differences in wealth and degree of preference. Quadratic funding fixes this problem to an extent as seen in the example described earlier:

i. Those who wanted `park A` donated what they could afford without losing the power to properly express their preference for that public good. Quadratic funding empowers *every* individual (irrespective of wealth) to influence the allocation of capital to public goods. This solves the issue of rational indifference and increases willingness to participate in collective action projects. 

ii. Other donors who wanted `park B` were able to express the strength of their preferences for that public good by contributing more money to its development. Perhaps, unknown to most people, `park B` has more long-term benefits for the community than `park A`. In this scenario, quadratic voting/funding prevents widespread ignorance from canceling out the wisdom of informed citizens. 

#### Reducing negative externalities

Under a regular free-market democratic system, everyone would be forced to pay equally for a public good—whether they wanted it or not. But, as demonstrated in the example, quadratic voting/funding ensures individual pay for a public if and only if they want it. 

Another negative externality that quadratic funding mitigates is the incentive to maximize profits at the expense of consumers (the development of `Park B` was still subsidized by the matching pool even if it had low support). Why is this important? It means those who build public goods have fewer reasons to try and extract profits from consumers through any means possible. If `park B` were built solely with investors' funds, the incentive to recoup the initial investment—for example, by charging visitors high fees—would be high. 

## How Ethereum improves quadratic funding for public goods {#how-ethereum-improves-quadratic-funding} 

Some may ask: "Why do you need a blockchain to coordinate a quadratic funding round when it can be implemented on a regular online platform?" There are two major issues with running quadratic voting on regular applications:

1. **Sybil attacks**: A [Sybil attack](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/sybil-attacks-explained) occurs when someone participating in an online platform creates multiple identities to increase their influence within that system. Deploying social media bots is an example of a Sybil attack. Due to the high value of individual contributions in a quadratic funding scheme, cheaters may try to game the system by creating different profiles and swing voting outcomes. This would corrupt the system and reduce the usefulness of quadratic voting in gauging interest in specific public goods. 

2. **Bribery and collusion**: It is possible to bribe voters to donate to a particular project (even if they prefer another option), thereby artificially inflating perceived preference for the former. This defeats the purpose of voting since the votes cast by a bribed individual may not reflect their true preference. Hence, just like Sybil attacks, bribery and collusion reduce the effectiveness of quadratic funding mechanisms. 

Ethereum mitigates both problems in the following ways:

### Decentralized identity {#decentralized-identity} 

[Decentralized identity](/decentralized-identity/) allows individuals to verify their identity online without relying on a central authority, such as governments or service providers. This is usually done in a way that minimizes the exposure of personal information to third parties. 

Some [decentralized identity protocols](/decentralized-identity/#use-decentralized-identity) have built-in cryptoeconomic incentives to discourage users from creating multiple identities to game the system. By integrating such tools with the voting process, quadratic funding applications reduce the risk of Sybil attacks. 

### Zero-knowledge proofs {#zero-knowledge-proofs} 

[Zero-knowledge proofs](/zero-knowledge-proofs/) allowing for proving the validity of a claim without exposing the underlying information. For example, Alice can prove her status as a United States citizen without having to provide her passport details. This feature makes zero-knowledge proofs are useful for preventing bribery and collusion in on-chain voting schemes as explained below:

As a rule, "bribe-for-vote" schemes only work if the briber can verify that the bribee voted for their preferred option. Without proof that bribing voters affected the outcome, malicious actors intent on manipulating a vote are less likely to offer bribes. Information about transactions performed on the Ethereum blockchain is public, hence executing bribery and collusion is easier (users can provide transaction data as proof of voting for the briber's choice).

But what if it was possible to publish results of an on-chain vote, while concealing specifics of individual votes—without reducing the integrity of the process? This is precisely what [Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413) seeks to achieve (albeit with some trust assumptions). 

Using MACI, it is possible to tally results from a quadratic voting round without needing to publish a breakdown of votes cast by each user. This is achieved using a combination of Ethereum smart contracts for recording and aggregating votes from users and [zero-knowledge proof](/zero-knowledge-proofs/) circuits that prove the vote tallying was performed correctly. 

MACI also allows users to submit multiple votes with the caveat that only votes encrypted with a valid keypair will be processed. Hence, a bribee could vote for a briber's choice using an invalid keypair, but the latter cannot know if the vote was valid or not (since the final tally doesn't say how each voter voted). Here's how the [MACI documentation](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/master/specs) describes it:

> When Alice casts her vote, she signs her vote with her private key, encrypts her signature with Dave's public key, and submits the result to the smart contract.
Each voter may change her keypair at any time. To do this, she creates and signs a key-change command, encrypts it, and sends it to the smart contract. This makes it impossible for a briber to ever be sure that their bribe has any effect on the bribee's vote.

> If Bob, for instance, bribes Alice to vote a certain way, she can simply use the first public key she had registered ⁠— which is now void ⁠— to cast a vote. Since said vote is encrypted, as was the key-changing message which Alice had previously sent to Dave, Bob has no way to tell if Alice had indeed voted the way he wanted her to.
Even if Alice reveals the cleartext of her vote to Bob, she just needs to not show him the updated key command that she previously used to invalidate that key. In short, as long as she had submitted a single encrypted command before her vote, there is no way to tell if said vote is valid or not.

Already, some quadratic funding applications have [integrated with MACI](https://clr.fund/#/about/maci) to reduce the impact of bribery and collusion. It is hoped that this would disincentivize malicious actors from trying to corrupt the quadratic funding process by bribing voters to signal false preferences for certain projects.
