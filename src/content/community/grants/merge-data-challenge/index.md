# The Merge data challenge {#the-merge-data-challenge}

_Up until four weeks after the Merge, the Ethereum Foundation is sponsoring a Merge data analysis and data visualization blog post challenge. Here are all the details you need._

<Divider />

Calling all Ethereans, data scientists, data engineers, data visualizers, developers, and anyone interested in digging into Ethereum data!

The [Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) is coming, providing a more secure and sustainable home for Ethereum -- as well as more data, lots and lots of data. And **the Ethereum community needs your help to make sense of it all.**

- _What new visualizations help provide insight into proof-of-stake Ethereum?_
- _How do the Consensus-Layer and Execution-Layer interact? Are there differences across client pairs in communication patterns, efficiency, etc? Are their good places to optimise?_
- _What, if anything, changed on the network at the point of the Merge -- block propagation times, p2p connections, transaction mempool performance, etc?_
- _Did the Merge affect core Beacon Chain activity -- attestation performance, blocks missed, sync committees?_
- _Did user activity noticeably change after the Merge? What about MEV?_
- _What new tools can you build to collect and analyze data in the post-Merge network?_

## The challenge {#the-challenge}

**Document your best Merge data insights in the most readable blog post possible – for prizes!**

The Ethereum Foundation is running this challenge because there's a lot to learn and discover from the Merge mainnet activity. Your findings will give the Ethereum community -- from beginners to researchers and client developers -- important insight into the Merge.

Get started now if you want to gather date from both _before_ and _after_ the big event!

### How to submit {#how-to-submit}

Anyone is free to submit, here's how:

1.  Collect and analyze Merge data
    - Either with existing tools
    - Or for the extra ambitious, build your own tool and tell us about it!
2.  Detail out your work in a blog post
3.  Submit!

<!-- TODOD LINK TO new submission form) -->
<!-- <ButtonLink to="">Submit blog post</ButtonLink> -->

_You may submit more than one blog post! So long as each posts focuses on a different visualisation or piece of analysis_

In addition to the prompt questions above, here's a [wishlist of data analysis avenues to explore](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/merge-data-comp-wish).

A group of Ethereum community members will evaluate your submissions and awards will go to the top blog posts <Emoji svg text=":trophy:" />

<h2>Deadline <Emoji svg text=":alarm_clock:" /></h2>

The deadline for submissions is **four weeks after the merge** (precise date TBD).

<h2>Prizes <Emoji svg text=":money_with_wings:" /></h2>

Up to **USD $30,000**

_Entries must be considered sufficiently impactful/insightful by the community judging team to be eligible for rewards._

## Requirements {#requirements}

- Blog post must be in English.
  - There are no length requirements.
- Blog posts must be public and original.
- Data analysis or visualization must concern [Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) network data.
- Tools and scripts used (and created) must be free and open source and referenced in the blog post.

## Judging criteria {#judging-criteria}

_Surprise us with your creativity! But here are some judging criteria considerations:_

- Overall quality and clarity of data analysis or data visualization.
  - Quality of insights into the Merge, clients, and Ethereum in general.
- Insights that lead to substantive changes/improvements in client implementations or specifications.
- Analyses or visualizations that help a non-technical audience gain insight into the network.
- Quality of contribution to the Ethereum tooling ecosystem (if applicable).

## How to get started {#started}

- Run / sync a [Mainnet client pair](LINK TO mainnet announcement) (or multiple clients).
- Dig around a block explorer:
  - [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) / [`BeaconScan`](https://beaconscan.com/)
  - [`Beaconcha.in`](https://beaconcha.in/)
- Experiment with client APIs for single node statistics (i.e. [beacon-APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs) and [execution-APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/)).
- Experiment with [`ethdo`](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo), [`rumor`](https://github.com/protolambda/rumor), [`zcli`](https://github.com/protolambda/zcli), [`chaind`](https://github.com/wealdtech/chaind), [Ethereum ETL](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl), [Ethereum 2 ETL](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum2-etl), and other existing data gathering and analysis tools.
- Write new tools to gather data.
- Crunch some numbers and spin up some graphs.
- Publish your analysis or visualization!
