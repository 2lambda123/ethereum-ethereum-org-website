## What is decentralized science (DeSci)?

Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that builds on the open science ideals of scientific knowledge being a public good. DeSci aims to build open infrastructure for funding, creating, and distributing scientific knowledge using web3.

Science is the process of discovering new truths about the world. These truths power the technological progress that allow us to navigate our environment more skillfully. As a consequence,  scientific knowledge enables human quality of life to improve over time. It is also fundamental to addressing species-level existential risks such as climate change or pandemics. 

To discover truths about the world, scientists need access to funding, scientific tools and communication channels. When control over these ressources is too centralized, new and unconventional ideas are often not explored. The goal of DeSci is focused on building decentralized resources for scientists - so everyone can participate in new scientific discovery.
