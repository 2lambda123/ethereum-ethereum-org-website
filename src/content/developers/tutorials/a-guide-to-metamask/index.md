This tutorial will guide you step by step through some important topics on working with MetaMask to give you the basics for a good foundation. If you wish to view the open souce project I've made with React.js to transact with MetaMask, please visit [https://github.com/blakewood84/metamask-transactions](https://github.com/blakewood84/metamask-transactions)!

## Initializing Your Application {#initialize-your-application}

The first and most important step is initializing your app to support MetaMask. To do this you must check if MetaMask exists by calling `window.ethereum` in the browser. The code below will check if MetaMask exists by seeing if `window.ethereum === 'undefined'`. If `window.ethereum` is infact undefined, then we will alert the user to please install MetaMask:

## Step 2: Add your collectable to MetaMask {#add-nft-to-metamask}

Once you‚Äôre on the Ropsten network, select the ‚ÄúCollectibles‚Äù tab on the right and add the NFT smart contract address and the ERC-721 token ID of your NFT ‚Äî which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash from your NFT deployed in Part II of our tutorial.
