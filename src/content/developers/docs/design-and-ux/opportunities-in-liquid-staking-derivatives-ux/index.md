In the ever-evolving landscape, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) have emerged as a significant area of interest. Newer LSD projects should focus their attention more on user experience in order to succeed.

## The Staking Pool Challenge  {#the-staking-pool-challenge}
Newer staking pools often find themselves in a tight spot when competing against established players in the market. These larger players command substantial liquidity, making it **challenging for new entrants** to attract users and offer competitive yields.

A few major players have established a stronghold in the LST (Liquid Staking Tokens) market. This dominance poses a significant barrier for newer pools trying to carve out their niche. In an attempt to differentiate themselves, many new pools are turning to intricate staking setups, but this might not be a good approach. 

**Is your attention being misdirected around your LSD strategy when there are other potential unique selling points to consider?**

## Understanding User Behavior  {#understanding-user-behavior}

Surprisingly, **65% of users do nothing with their LST** (October 2023). This finding highlights a potential gap in user engagement. While projects discuss complex Liquid Staking Strategies, even the most simple ones are often **not attractive to users**.

![Example of strategies](./2.png)

Staking pool projects tend to communicate to each user the same way, disregarding the unique contexts. This is wrong.

- 224k users staked $1024 or less
- 125k users staked between $1024 and $32k
- 24k users staked between $32k to $1 million
- Exchange users average around $600 

A user with 1 ETH and 100 ETH has a **different risk profile/strategy** they are thinking about. **This creates an opportunity to offer a tailored and targeted product to the unique needs of specific user segment**.

## The Importance of UX  {#importance-of-ux}
The disparity in how investors understand and use Liquid staking points to a need for better UX design. The concept of rebasing (1 LSD = 1 ETH) versus reward-bearing LSDs (1 LSD = ? ETH) can be confusing. Issues like full deposit queues further complicate the user's journey. 

A well-designed UX can demystify these concepts and make the investment process more intuitive and accessible.

**Where are your users? How can you get in front of them? How can you understand their desires?**
Coinbase is a great example as they originally started with no liquid staking token and are now one of the largest staking pools (regardless of charging more than some competition). The reason for that was simply having access to the users. 

## User Research  {#user-research}

Most projects should ask these questions:

- Do your users care about your LST strategies?
- What are users doing with their LST?
- What would motivate them to move from a competitor?
- What is most important for the user?
- What user segments is your staking pool targeting?
- What new communication channels should you explore to access new pools of users?

As the market evolves,**it will be crucial for new projects to focus on clear, simple, and user-friendly platforms**.

Understanding and catering to user behavior will be **vital** in building successful and sustainable staking pools in the competitive landscape of DeFi.
