# Testing contributions to ethereum.org {#testing-contributions}

The QA testing contributions is an initiative to test release candidates for ethereum.org before they are deployed into production. Testing is a vital part in a products release cycle to catch bugs and regressions that may have been introduced before a release.

If you'd like to get involved come say hi in our `ðŸ‘¾ ï½œ website-code`. We meet bi-weekly in the `ðŸŽ“ | office-hours-voice` channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org). Notes on our process:

- **Every Tuesday** we create a release candidate that goes into the `staging` branch
- Infor about the release candidate is posted in the `ðŸ‘¾ ï½œ website-code` channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org)
- Find the release notes for the release candidate on the [GitHub repositories releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/releases)
  - The release candidate will be tagged as a `pre-release`
- **On Thursday** the release candidate is published on production
- More info on the deploy process for ethereum.org can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/docs/deploy-process.md)

## How to get involved {#how-to-get-involved}

There are a number of ways to get involved with testing. We are looking for any content, design, or user experience bugs or regressions that may have been introduced in the release candidate.

### Content {#content}

In every release there are content edits, and sometimes new pages being added to ethereum.org. One way to get involved for content contributions is reviewing new content and edits to make sure there is no wrong information, or grammar mistakes.

### Design {#design}

In some releases there will be changes to styles for components and pages on ethereum.org. As we roll out our [design system](/about/#design-system), we want to make sure there is no regression to designs and that we are maintaining this system. One way to get involved would be to test the release candidate and find any regressions that may have been introduced and report them. Another way to get involved is during testing, if you find other design issues or improvements, creating an issue on the repository advocating for these improvements.

### User experience {#user-experience}

One of our goals is to add more interactive elements to ethereum.org to supplement and improve content and learning for our users. With added interactivity comes a more complex codebase and increased chances for regressions in our user experience. One way to get involved for test release candidates is to test out these new pieces of functionality being added and provide any feedback on them and any issues or regressions found while testing them out.
