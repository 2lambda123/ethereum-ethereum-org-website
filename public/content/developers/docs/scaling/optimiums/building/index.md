Multiple projects provide implementations of optimium that you can integrate into your dapps:

**Arbitrum Nova**: _Nova is an optimium chain based on Arbitrum’s AnyTrust technology. AnyTrust chains like Arbitrum Nova are able to provide lower costs and higher throughput for dapps by relying on a data availability committee (DAC) to store and verify transaction data off-chain instead of storing on L1._

- [Protocol overview](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust)
- [Developer documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/gentle-introduction-dapps)
- [Technology and risk summary](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/nova)

**Metis Andromeda**: _Metis Andromeda is an optimium chain that offers low-fee and high-throughput execution for EVM-compatible smart contracts. Transaction data is stored off-chain with a decentralized storage network (MEMO) and only cryptographic commitments (Merkle roots) to transaction batches and state updates are stored on Ethereum._

**Mantle**: _Mantle is an EVM-compatible optimium that combines rollup-like technology with a decentralized off-chain data availability to power dapps that offer superior UX, low gas fees, and faster finality. Note that both fraud proof technology and data availability service are still under development (no fault proofs in v1—block proposers are trusted to submit valid state roots—and batches are stored with the sequencer)._
