## What is decentralized finance (DeFi)? {#what-is-defi}

Decentralized finance, also known as DeFi, is a peer-to-peer financial ecosystem built on Ethereum. It enables financial services like payments, lending, borrowing, and trading using Ethereum and <a href="/glossary/#smart-contract">smart contracts</a>, which do not require any trusted central authority or bank to settle.

### DeFi compared to traditional financial services {#defi-compared}

Defi stands out from traditional financial services in several significant ways:

- **Self custody** - Users maintain custody of their assets, guaranteeing access and keeping control for themselves
- **Open access** - Decentralized finance operates across border, providing open access to financial services without geographical restrictions
- **Transparent** - The code underlying decentralized finance is open sourced, allowing anyone to inspect how these financial systems operate and where funds are moving
- **Composable** - Financial primatives, such as lending, can iterated on to create new applications
- **Censorship resistant** - Decentralized finance is built on decentralized blockchains, making it extremely difficult to censor transactions

## How does DeFi work? {#how-does-defi-work}

In the traditional banking system, every time you make a transaction, whether it's depositing money, transferring funds, or making a purchase, the details of that transaction are recorded in a private ledger. This ledger, often referred to as your transaction history, is maintained and controlled by a centralized financial institution, such as a bank. This centralized system serves as the custodian of your financial records, granting them exclusive access to the information within your account.

In contrast, Ethereum operates on a decentralized and open blockchain. Instead of relying on a single financial institution to maintain your transaction records, Ethereum uses distributed ledger technology. This means that each transaction is recorded in a public ledger, accessible to anyone participating in the Ethereum network. These transactions are stored in a secure and immutable manner, making them transparent and tamper-proof. This decentralized approach allows for transparency and verification by all participants in the Ethereum network. Every user can independently verify transactions, eliminating the need for trust in a centralized authority.

You can think of DeFi in layers:

1. Protocol and network - Ethereum rules of operation, and distributed network of nodes
2. The blockchain - the data containing transaction history and state of accounts
3. Primitives - composable smart contracts such as token contracts (assets) and other finance tools
4. The applications - user interfaces that are used to interact with the protocols

## What can you do with DeFi? {#what-can-you-do-with-defi}

### Payments {#payments}

One of the most basic forms of decentralized finance is digital peer-to-peer value transfers. Ethereum is designed for sending transactions around the world. You are able to send a payment by entering the recipients account address, and send funds directly in a matter of seconds to minutes. To send of receive payments, you will need a wallet.

### Stablecoins {#stablecoins}

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose price is pegged to the value of another asset, typically a fiat currency. Stablecoins introduced the option for users to hold cryptocurrency with a stable price not subject to high volatility. While the name implies stablecoins are stable, they are not without risk, and are often more centralized than other forms of cryptocurrency due to them commonly being backed by reserves in a centralized institution.

### Lending and borrowing {#lending-and-borrowing}

You can lend your assets to lending pools for others to take loans out against. When you lend assets to a pool, you can earn interest based on the demand for borrowing of that asset. Most loans in DeFi are over-collateralized and use cryptocurrencies like ETH as collateral, meaning you deposit more crypto than you borrow. Smart contracts handle the rules, like how much collateral you need and the interest rate you borrow at. If your collateral value drops below a certain level, it's automatically sold to cover the loan.

### Decentralized exchanges {#dex}

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a digital marketplace for cryptocurrency trading that operates without a central authority or intermediary, and allows users to maintain full control of their assets throughout the entire exchange. It enables peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies directly between users through smart contracts, where users create pools of liquidity to be used for exchange for a fee, eliminating the need for a traditional intermediary like a bank or exchange.

### Quadratic funding {#quadratic-funding}

In quadratic funding, the matching pool accumulates funds from various sources and uses a quadratic formula to match contributions to public goods projects like open source software. The formula calculates matching funds based on the number of unique contributors and the total contributions, with the matching funds growing exponentially as more contributors join. This approach ensures that smaller or less-known projects can compete with larger ones, fostering equitable distribution of funds. The matching pool's funds are sourced from the community, encouraging broad participation and community engagement, often with blockchain technology ensuring transparency while maintaining contributor privacy.
