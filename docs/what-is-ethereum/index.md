## The basics {#the-basics}

Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain with:

- over 100,000,000 addresses. An address is like an Ethereum account. You need one to send and receive [Ether](#meet-ether) and connect to [Ethereum applications](#the-applications).
- over \$10,000,000,000 USD in value transferred in transactions
- over 1000 applications that you can try out today

<CardList smallTabletColumns="1" tabletColumns="2" desktopColumns="3" flat small clickable="false" :items="$page.frontmatter.stats" />

The best way to understand Ethereum is to get to know Ether, the applications and the thriving community.

### Meet Ether, Ethereum's cryptocurrency {#meet-ether}

**Like other blockchains, Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH).** [ETH is digital money](https://ethereum.org/eth/). If you’ve heard of [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/), ETH has many of the same features. It is purely digital, and you can send it to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. The supply of ETH isn’t controlled by any government or company - it is decentralized and it is scarce. People all over the world use ETH to make payments, as a store of value, or as collateral.

And because Ethereum is programmable, developers have invented lots of other crypto tokens you can buy, sell or use with Ethereum products. This includes stablecoins, which give you all the freedom of cryptocurrency with the stability of traditional currencies like dollars. Stablecoins are much better for spending because their value isn't as volatile as ETH.

### The applications {#the-applications}

Ethereum applications allow you to interact with digital money in new ways. From wallets that let you hold, send and receive crypto to products that let you create your own tokens or earn interest on your digital assets. But not all Ethereum applications are purely financial. Many developers build Ethereum applications because they can be decentralized. This means no one controls them and they don't need to store data in servers.

**Right now, thousands of developers all over the world are working on Ethereum applications. Here are some that you can use today:**

- [**Cryptocurrency wallets**](/wallets/) that let you make cheap, instant payments with ETH or other assets
- [**Financial applications**](https://defipulse.com/) that let you borrow, lend, or invest your digital assets
- [**Decentralized markets**](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/decentralized-exchanges/what-are-decentralized-exchanges/), that let you trade digital assets, or even trade “predictions” about events in the real world
- [**Games**](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/games/what-is-blockchain-gaming/) where you own in-game assets, and can even make real money
- **And much,** much more.

### The community {#the-community}

There is no company or centralized organization that controls Ethereum. From the core protocol to the applications, it's maintained by a global community of contributors.

It includes developers, crypto-economic researchers, artists, cypherpunks, mining organizations, ETH holders, gamers, grandmothers, anarchists, fortune 500 companies, and, as of now, **you**.
